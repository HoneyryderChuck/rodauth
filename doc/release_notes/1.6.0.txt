= New Feature

* An http_basic_auth feature has been added, allowing the use of
  HTTP Basic Auth to login.

= New Configuration Options for jwt Feature

* jwt_session_hash has been added, for modifying the hash given before
  creating the JWT.  This can be used for setting JWT claims.
  Example:

    jwt_session_hash do
      super().merge(:exp=>Time.now.to_i + 120)
    end

* jwt_decode_opts has been added for specifying additional options to
  JWT.decode. Among other things, this allows for JWT claim
  verification. Example:

    jwt_decode_opts(:verify_expiration=>true)

* jwt_session_key has been added, specifying a key in the JWT that
  will be used to store session information, instead of storing
  session keys in the root of the JWT.  Use of this option can avoid
  issues with reserved JWT claim names, and will probably be enabled
  by default starting in Rodauth 2.

* jwt_symbolize_deeply? configuration method has been added, for
  whether to symbolize nested keys when decoding a JWT session hash.

= Other Improvements

* The reset_password feature no longer attempts to render a template
  in json-only mode.

* The jwt_payload method is now memoized by default.
